# HW2: WHILE

---
#### Requirement:

run `pip install lark-parser --upgrade` to install `lark`, which is a parsing library I used.

#### How to run:

`python3` is needed to run the file. `Makefile` generates an executable called `while`, or simply run `python while.py`.

#### The custom test cases are in the file [hard.bats](tests/hard.bats)
